It is no secret that loans can be lifesavers, especially when they are used to clear some existing debts. Of course, their effectiveness does depend on the terms they are secured with. But the usefulness of long term unsecured loans in times of great financial pressure cannot be denied.

Typically, these kinds of loans can range in size up to $25,000 and can be repaid over 5 to 7 years, depending on the lender. However, they can be difficult to get approval with bad credit scores unless there are ample signs that the loan is affordable.

And as with all unsecured loans, the interest rate charged to those with poor credit scores can be quite high - in some cases as high as 20%. But the opportunity to access much-needed funds, and set about addressing financial troubles is too good to ignore.

But what about when these long term loans are not within your grasp? What are the options available to bad credit borrowers, and what terms can they expect? Here are 3 worth considering.
